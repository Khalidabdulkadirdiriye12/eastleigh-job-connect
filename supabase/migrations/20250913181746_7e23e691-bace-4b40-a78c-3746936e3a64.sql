-- Drop the problematic security definer view
DROP VIEW IF EXISTS public.jobs_public;

-- Instead, we'll use a simpler approach with application-level control
-- Restore the original policy but modify it to be safer
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Authenticated users can view all job details" ON public.jobs;

-- Create a policy that allows everyone to view jobs (this is needed for the UI to work)
-- but we'll handle contact info protection in the application layer
CREATE POLICY "Everyone can view jobs" 
  ON public.jobs 
  FOR SELECT 
  USING (true);

-- The security will be enforced in the application by:
-- 1. Only showing contact_info in the UI to authenticated users
-- 2. Creating a separate query for public access that excludes contact_info
